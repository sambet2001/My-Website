      <p>The First Two Links On The Top Tab</p>
      <p>The first Two tabs f my website show you a link back to this spectacular page, and an About Me page that you will either find intersting, or find it to be a huge cringe fest. Either way you'll have to look at it, but never mind that. Hopefully I can make my website even cooler sooner with a few adjustments, and add on a few things as I learn in the future.If you didnt know me before, well you'll learn a little bit about me from my other ppage previously mentioned. Not a lot, just a little so I am just rambling at this point which I do a lot, but hopefully you veiwing this sight get the point.</p>

      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <img src="This is nature.jpg" alt="Nature walk" width="250" height="100">
      <p>So this is my title card I guess, it's nothing much, but I hope that little things about me are slightly enjoyable. I have two cats and three dogs that all do drugs, like seriously they all are on crack with how hyper and jumpy they are. I enjoy nature, especially hiking and camping, and my hobbies are drawing and i read just a lot. I'm at ths school for choir, so I think that's enough about me just enjoy my website!</p>
