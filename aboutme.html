      <p>My Animals Firstly</p>
      <p>This image that is messed up,that I am trying to fix, is my puppy Wilbur who is a year and a half old. I love him to death, and he is my life besides my cat son named Luca whom meows at the top of my lungs when he can't find me. Not to mention hes literally three years old. Cora is the oldest at the age of seven, another dog, and finally my puppy Daisy who falls over her own two paws if she wags her tail too hard. Snowflake is my senile cat who chases shadows, and I seriously think that those crack dogs drove her crazy becuase now she jumps and chases shadows. </p>

      <p>I Take A Lot Of Pictures Of The Sky</p>
      <p>This is an example of what I do while bored in the car, so yeah this is fantastic. I also draw a lot of pictures of the sky, and I read a lot of vivid books that for some reason always describe a blazing sky. I guess I am drawn to it more than I thought I was while typing this :)</p>

      <p>So this is my title card I guess, it's nothing much, but I hope that little things about me are slightly enjoyable. I have two cats and three dogs that all do drugs, like seriously they all are on crack with how hyper and jumpy they are. I enjoy nature, especially hiking and camping, and my hobbies are drawing and i read just a lot. I'm at ths school for choir, so I think that's enough about me just enjoy my website!</p>
